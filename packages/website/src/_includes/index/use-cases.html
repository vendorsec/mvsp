                A standardized application security baseline for vendor selection simplifies the sourcing team's job and
                provides a clear set of requirements for enterprise-ready products and services. MVSP is designed to be
                brief, concise, and easy to understand so that it can be included in RFP documents without causing delays
                to the sales cycle.</p>

                Security teams often have a great number of requirements pertinent to providing digital services. Prioritizing
                “security as a feature” can be challenging for software teams. MVSP provides a simple set of minimum controls
                that are both easy for product teams to understand and integrate and easy to verify by the security and
                compliance team.</p>

                To ensure the security posture of third-party suppliers, large companies can incorporate MVSP into their standard
                contractual controls. By ensuring that third-parties acknowledge and respond to the MVSP controls at the initial
                RFP stage, agreeing to contractual controls based on MVSP can be further expedited.</p>
