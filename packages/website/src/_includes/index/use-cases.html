          A standardized application security baseline for vendor selection simplifies the sourcing team's job and
          provides a clear set of requirements for enterprise-ready products and services. MVSP is designed to be
          brief, concise, and easy to understand so that it can be included in RFP documents without causing delays
          to the sales cycle.

          Smaller companies that are not yet mature enough to invest in large compliance efforts such as SOC 2 or PCI DSS
          can use MVSP as a baseline to measure the security posture of their MVP and create a roadmap for continuous
          improvement. MVPs often lack essential security controls, however to attract enterprise customers, a clear
          security roadmap must be a priority.

          Security teams often have a great number of requirements pertinent to providing digital services. Prioritizing
          “security as a feature” can be challenging for software teams. MVSP provides a simple set of minimum controls
          that are both easy for product teams to understand and integrate and easy to verify by the security and
          compliance team.

          To ensure the security posture of third-party suppliers, large companies can incorporate MVSP into their standard
          contractual controls. By ensuring that third-parties acknowledge and respond to the MVSP controls at the initial
          RFP stage, agreeing to contractual controls based on MVSP can be further expedited.
